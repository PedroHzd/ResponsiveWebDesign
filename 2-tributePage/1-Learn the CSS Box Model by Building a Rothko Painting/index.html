            <!--  In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas. 
                The content is where the element resides like <img>, <h1></h1>, or <p></p>.

                    The content is surrounded by a space called padding. Similar to how bubble wrap separates
                an item. The word padding does exactly what it means. It pads elments with space. 

                    The border contains the padding and content space. You can style the border an infinite amount
                of ways but the space alocated to padding and content will always be insider the border.

                    Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other 
                boxes or elements. In the picture, the bottom element has a larget top margin so the content 
                area is pushed further down the page.
