                        <!--<p></p> elements are block-level, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.
                            You need to apply some styling so they behave more like inline elements.     

                            However, styling these p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines 
                            in the code creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the 
                            second one to shift to the next line. 

                            You could change the width to 49% on both p elements but that leaves a bit of space on the right.
                            Instead, place both p elements in the same line in the editor, making sure there is no space
                            between them. This removes the extra space that comes with inline elements.
