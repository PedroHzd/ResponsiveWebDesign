                <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" checked> Indoor</label>
                <!--<label></label> elements are used to help associate the text (inside the input element) with the input element.
                    Especially for assistive technologies like screen readers.
                    Ex. <label><input> Outdoor</label> makes it so clicking the word Outdoor also selects the corresponding radio button.

                    The input <input> element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. self-closing
                  
                    id="" attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from
                    all other id values for the entire page. 

                    type="radio" You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options. 
                    
                    name="" Having the same value for the name attribute on the input elements prevents from choosing both of them.
                    Making it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other radio button. 
                    Without have the same name attribute, both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. 

                    value="" When you submit the form, the data from the button is based on its name and value attributes.
                    If you don't include a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on
                    (the value for the name attribute), which is not very useful when you have multiple buttons.
                    indoor-outdoor=on doesn't make it clear which button the user submited. It could of been either Indoor or Outdoor. 

                    checked is an attribute with no value. It makes a checkbox or radio button be selected by default. Just add 
                    the attribute making sure theres space between other attributes. 
                -->
                <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
              </fieldset>

              <fieldset>
                <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
                <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving" checked> <label for="loving">Loving</label> <!--** The order of attributes DOES NOT matter **-->
                <!--type="checkbox" are commonly used in questions that may have more than one answer.
                  
                    value="" Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name/value attribute pairs. While the value attribute is
                    optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page. 
                    While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, 
                    especially when there are multiple checkboxes. 

                    for="" There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text
                    within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute. 
                -->
                <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy"> <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
                <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="energetic"> <label for="energetic">Energetic</label>
              </fieldset>

              <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
              <!--type="" There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute.
                  You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer. 

                  name="" In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must 
                  give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. 

                  placeholder="" Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter in an input.

                  required -- To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the 
                  required attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Just add the word
                  and make sure theres space between other attributes.
                -->
              <button type="submit">Submit</button>
              <!--<button></button> Use the button element to create a clickable button. 
                  The default behaviour of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in
                  the form's action attribute. 
                  
                  type="submit" However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. This attribute with a value of submit 
                  makes it clear that it's a submit button. 

                  <input> and <button></button> elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines but rather next to each other.
